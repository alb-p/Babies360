## Choreographed process
This BPMN Choreography diagram represents a service coordination between Parents and the Babies360 company. At the beginning Parents making an initial service request to Babies360. The company then checks for availability; if the availability doesn't match the parentâ€™s needs, the process will end. Once there's a match, Babies360 requests additional information from the Parents. After obtaining the needed details, Babies360 allocates the appropriate resources, like a babysitter, party organizer, or pedagogical consultant(they can be parallel). Following the service delivery, Babies360 manages the payment process and issues a payment notification to the Parents, concluding the transaction.
